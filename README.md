* Big Gamer
* Love simple programs like autoclickers
* Like to mod and find glitches
* Also love climbing and spikeball
## Technical Background
Second year at GV, taken a couple years of consistent Jave programming. Not much experience in other languages, like to mess around with programs on my laptop, but most of them have nicer interfaces. Like to learn more about the backend of apps and programs to edit them in ways I want.
